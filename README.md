## %ex2pac() : excel to package
1. Put information of SAS package you want to create into **an excel file**
2. %ex2pac(excel_file, package_location) will convert the excel into SAS package folders and files including %generatePackage() at the end
   (Use template_package_meta.xlsx)

**This allows you to create SAS packages via simple format of excel!**
