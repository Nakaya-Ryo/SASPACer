## `%ex2pac()` macro <a name="ex2pac-macros-1"></a> ######

%ex2pac is a macro to convert excel with package information into
SAS package folders and files.

- Parameters
	excel_file :
		full path for excel file which contains package information
	package_location :
		location where package files to be stored.
		Subfolder named package name will be created under the location.

- Excel file to read
	Easy to understand the structure. Take a look at it anyway.
	In sheets like macros, %ex2pac uses body information if body column is filled,
	while refers file in location column if body column is blank.
	(This is a situation where macros(or other files) were already created somewhere in a file and
	would like to use it instead of copying contents in body column of the excel.)

- Flow of the macro
	1. Create package subfolder in the location.
		Name of the subfolder will be set as the package name.
	2. Create description.sas
	3. Create license.sas
	4. Create subfolders like 01_formats, 02_functions, etc. in reference to
		the excel sheet names.
	5. Create sas files based on information described in each excel sheet
	6. Run %generatePackages()

- Sample code
%ex2pac(
	excel_file=C:\Temp\template_package_meta.xlsx,
	package_location=C:\Temp\SAS_PACKAGES\packages) ;
